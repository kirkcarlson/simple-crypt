This is a "simple" program that is intended to introduce students to JavaScript and DOM object manipulation using
using some simple encryption programs. Code is included for Caeser cypher, log fence encryption, pig pen encryption
and Morse code.

The simple-crypt.html file defines the basic elements of a page, but does not include any contents. This just defines the
basic framework for the page.

The simple-crypt.css file formats the elements of the page.

The simple-crypt.js file is the heart of the page. It puts contents into the elements, provides encryption and decryption functions,
and dynamically updates page elmements as required. This uses only built-in JavaScript to show students how to access
HTML elements, their style attributes and their content.
